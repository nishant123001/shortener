# LiveLike Backend Code Test

## Goal

Implement an HTTP-based API that at a minimum allows end-user developers to shorten a link, like [bitly][bitly]. The API endpoint that does the shortening should accept a URL and return a short link that resolves to the original URL. It is up to you to design the URL structure along with the request and response formats.

A user should be able to visit the shortened link and be brought to the original link.

## Guidelines

Reviewing a code test can be subjective, so in the interest of transparency you'll get additional points for:

* Demonstration of understanding of [HTTP][http]
* Use of established [Python idioms][python-idioms]
* Attention to [Django style][django-style]

We're interested in hearing about your design process and the tradeoffs and decisions you made, you can include them in your pull request message.

## Submission

A blank [Django][django] project is located in the src/ directory of this repository.
To submit, open a pull request against the repository with your implementation of the rest of the project.
